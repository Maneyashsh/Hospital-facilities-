<p>I’m a delicate and sensitive person, and Dr. Sujeeth I was totally impressed by the way I was treated first time when I met him in 2008 and the way he followed up. He is not only an Excellent Doctor , he is simple, superb Human being, Sober, approachable, a Great Social Worker, friendly approach with smiling face with his selfless service with his selfless services. Always amazing treatment. He is an extraordinary intelligent Doctor with human values. Nice advise, hardly find such non commercial Doctors in this era. Apart from dedication , he also has slight wit which impresses me more resulting in great relief from stress while chatting with him. May God bless him and best wishes for the future.</p>

<p> Good doctor. He is very simple and gentle in his behavior. He will give sufficient time to each patient. He studies the patient and disease meticulously. We can freely interact with the doctor. He prefers surgery when it is very much required only. I never found commercial nature in him.</p>

<p> He is very caring and soft spoken. He is a dedicated Doctor. He operated on me for umbilical hernia around eight years ago. I am perfectly fine now. Our trust has been building up since then. The way he talks is half of the cure for your problem.</p>
